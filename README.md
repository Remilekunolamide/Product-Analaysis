 # This Project shows an analysis of a Firm that specializes in Bikes and cycling accessories
## Data Exploration
For the data exploration process, filter, find and replace, and the sorting functions were used and the following were the common observations;

*From the transaction dataset, I found inconsistent customer IDs these might be due to data loss or incomplete data computation*

*From customer Demographic datasets, inaccuracy of gender naming was observed as â€œ F, U, Femal, M, Male*

*Missing data values were observed from different datasets given*

*inconsistent data types with the same attributes were also observed*

### The Vlookup was used to combine datasets from different worksheets in order to satisfy the project objective
